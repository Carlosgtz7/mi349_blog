        Hi! My name is Carlos Gutierrez, and Iâ€™m a senior at Michigan State
        University studying Computer Science. I've always loved technology and
        problem solving which is what led me to pursue computer science. Besides
        school, sports take up a large portion of my attention (namely golf,
        tennis, bodybuilding, basketball, and football). In addition to this, I
        am also making an effort to pick up Spanish and learn to play the
        guitar.
      </p>

        Something you wouldn't know just from looking at me is I've always had a
        love for digital creation. This can take a bunch of different forms.
        I've dabbled in things such as making music, pixel art, and I would even
        through web design into this category. The one thing that stands above
        the rest though is content creation. I absolutely love the whole process
        of making videos. While I haven't been as involved in it since starting
        college, I want to get back into it again and really take it seriously.
      </p>
