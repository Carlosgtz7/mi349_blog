          <h2>The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of My Fantasy Football Team</h2>

        <p>
          This year is my second time playing fantasy football. Last year I was
          in a 12 man league with my buddies and managed to have the best record
          in the league (12-2) despite hardly knowing anything about football.
          This year I was hoping to keep that momentum going. On draft night,
          positions were revealed and I had the first overall pick. Things were
          really looking good, especially being a 14 man league this year having
          the first pick becomes significantly more valuable. Overall I would
          say drafting went pretty well, I had some heavy hitters on my team
          such as Joe Burrow and Jamarr Chase with plenty of other solid
          players.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to the week 1 of the season and things already took a
          turn. I took an unfortunate loss as many of my starters had horrible
          performances. Nothing to panic over of course, I lost week 1 last year
          and still finished 12-2 after all. It was week 2 where the team really
          crumbled before my eyes. Three of my starting players went down with
          serious injuries this week, one of them being Bengals quarterback Joe
          Burrow. This was the most devastating loss as without him the Bengals
          offense is significantly worse and I just so happen to have two more
          Bengals players on my roster.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point my team is in absolute shambles, so it was time to make
          some trades. In short, I made three trades where I essentially gave up
          Jamarr Chase, Kareem Hunt, Chris Godwin, and Bryce Young in exchange
          for Bijan Robinson, Tyreek Hill, Jameson Williams, Trevor Lawrence,
          and Bo Nix. To put into perspective how good these two trades were for
          my team I put together this chart below.
        </p>

        <h3>Trade Value Chart</h3>
        <table border="1">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Player Comparison</th>
              <th>Average Points</th>
              <th>Point Differential</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>Bryce Young + Joe Burrow for Bo Nix</th>
              <th>13.7 + 0 for 13.5</th>
              <th>
                Very even trade, Bo Nix is just way more consistent than Young.
                Also Burrow is out for the season.
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Jamarr Chase for Bijan Robinson</th>
              <th>16.7 for 20.1</th>
              <th>
                Not only does Bijan average more points, Jamarr's production
                will slow down since he has a backup quarterback throwing to
                him.
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Hunt + Godwin for Hill + Williams</th>
              <th>6.8 + 0 for 13.6 + 10.6</th>
              <th>
                Godwin is set to come back from injury soon but had two ankle
                surgeries; Not likely going to be the same player.
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Trevor Lawrence</th>
              <th>12.4</th>
              <th>
                Didn't give up anything for Lawrence, essentially got a backup
                quarterback for free.
              </th>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
