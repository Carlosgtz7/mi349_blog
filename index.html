          <h2>The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of My Fantasy Football Team</h2>

          This year is my second time playing fantasy football. Last year I was
          in a 12 man league with my buddies and managed to have the best record
          in the league (12-2) despite hardly knowing anything about football.
          This year I was hoping to keep that momentum going. On draft night,
          positions were revealed and I had the first overall pick. Things were
          really looking good, especially being a 14 man league this year having
          the first pick becomes significantly more valuable. Overall I would
          say drafting went pretty well, I had some heavy hitters on my team
          such as Joe Burrow and Jamarr Chase with plenty of other solid
          players.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to the week 1 of the season and things already took a
          turn. I took an unfortunate loss as many of my starters had horrible
          performances. Nothing to panic over of course, I lost week 1 last year
          and still finished 12-2 after all. It was week 2 where the team really
          crumbled before my eyes. Three of my starting players went down with
          serious injuries this week, one of them being Bengals quarterback Joe
          Burrow. This was the most devastating loss as without him the Bengals
          offense is significantly worse and I just so happen to have two more
          Bengals players on my roster.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point my team is in absolute shambles, so it was time to make
          some trades. In short, I made three trades where I essentially gave up
          Jamarr Chase, Kareem Hunt, Chris Godwin, and Bryce Young in exchange
          for Bijan Robinson, Tyreek Hill, Jameson Williams, Trevor Lawrence,
          and Bo Nix. To put into perspective how good these two trades were for
          my team I put together this chart below.

                Very even trade, Bo Nix is just way more consistent than Young.
                Also Burrow is out for the season.

                Not only does Bijan average more points, Jamarr's production
                will slow down since he has a backup quarterback throwing to
                him.

          <h2>How I Broke 80 for the First Time (and How Long it Took)</h2>
          <p>

          Breaking 80 is a mark many golfers use as sort of a gold standard for
          what you could consider a good player. For those that don’t know, the
          term “breaking 80” is defined by shooting a score of 79 or lower
          through 18 holes. According to CleverGolfer.com, roughly 2-5% of
          golfers ever break 80. It is a challenging goal that takes a
          significant amount of time and practice to achieve. With that being
          said, it’s not an impossible to goal to reach and in fact takes much
          less perfection than people realize. This post is going to detail the
          skillset I used to break 80 for the first time (and many more times
          after that).
        </p>
        <p>
          Often people think that you need to play flawless golf in order to
          shoot under 80, but this is not the case. A huge standard you need to
          hold yourself to when attempting to break 80 is to eliminate double
          bogey. If you have two double bogeys on your scorecard, chances are
          you won’t get two birdies to make up for that, and your chances of
          breaking 80 are gone. As far as actually hitting your clubs, I would
          say the most important parts are hitting fairly straight irons and
          having a solid chipping game. I’ve managed to straighten out my driver
          a bit over the years but it’s my iron game that really saves the day.
          As long as I can give myself a shot at the green with an iron, I’m
          good. With that being said I am by no means hitting every green in
          regulation, that’s why I think chipping might be the most important
          part to breaking 80 (for my game at least). As far as putting goes, I
          was able to break 80 with just ok putting, nothing special. One last
          thing I’ll say is crucial to have in your game is the ability to get
          out of sticky situations and playing within your abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaking 80 is an illusive goal to achieve but does not require
          anything close to perfect golf. As is the case with me, you can break
          80 by having just two good parts of your game while the rest is just
          ok.
